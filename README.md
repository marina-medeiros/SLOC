## Introduction

Counting the **lines of code** (LOC) of a programming project is a standard _software metric_
used to measure the size of a computer program.
This information may be used, for instance, to objectively measure the programming effort
done by a team of developers, as well as to estimate software documentation practices by
calculating the percentage of comments in a given project.

In this programming assignment you should design and develop a terminal application that
counts how many lines of code, comments, and blank lines were found
in one or more C/C++ source files provided as input, and prints out this information
to the standard output.

The application should provide interaction via a CLI (command line interface), and may receive
either a single C/C++ source file as input or a directory containing one or more source files.

Below you will find an example of expected output when running the application on a single C++ source file.

```
$ ./sloc src/main.cpp
Files processed: 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename            Language        Comments        Blank           Code            All
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
src/main.cpp        C++             140 (29.9%)     43 (9.2%)       320 (68.4%)     468
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This project may help you develop your object-oriented programming skills since you will need
to model this application with classes. This assignment also relies heavily on [strings](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) and [stream](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostringstream) manipulation, [file streams](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_fstream), the processing and parsing of command line arguments. Of course, you are encouraged to choose convenient data structures such as **lists** (`vector` or `array`), as well as **dictionary**, to help improve your solution and make the problem easier to solve.

## Input

The main data input for the program is either a single _file name_ of a C/C++ program or a _directory_ containing C/C++ source files.
Feel free to add support to other languages if you so desire.

Other input information are the options to select which type of sorting order you will use to present the data table, or if the user
wants to investigate the directory recursively.

## Interface

If you run `sloc` with no arguments, or with the flag `--help` or `-h` the program should display the _usage_ message to help the client to understand how to use the program.

```
$ ./build/sloc -h
Welcome to slocpp, version 1.0, (c) 2024 Selan, DIMAp, UFRN.
Usage: sloc [options] file/directory
Options:
  -h/--help       Display this information.
  -r              Look for files recursively in the directory provided.
  -s f/t/c/b/s/a  Sort table in ascending order by (f)ilename, (t) filetype,
                  (c)omments, (b)lank lines, (s)loc, or (a)ll. Default is to show
                  files in ordem of appearance.
  -S f/t/c/b/s/a  Same as above, but in descending order.
```

## Execution

After receiving and parsing the command-line arguments, your program may first try to create a list of valid C/C++ source files based on the input source. If the source is just a file name, you may need to _extract_ the file extension to see if it matches the accepted supported file extensions, listed below:

- `".cpp"`: a C/C++ program.
- `".c"`: a C program.
- `".h"`: a C/C++ header file.
- `".hpp"`: a C++ header file.

On the other hand, if your source is a directory name, you will need to access all the file names inside the source directory, check if they have the supported extensions listed above, and include them into the list of valid C/C++ source files.
Support code to access and retrieve a list of files present in a directory will be provided with the GitHub repository of this assignment.

After your program has created a list of valid C/C++ source files (that might have only one file, for instance), the next step is to open each of those files and begin the counting task (explained in the next section).

When the counting process is done and finished for the entire list of files, your application should print to the standard output a **table** presenting the result of the counting **per file** with a grand total at the bottom of the table, in case your program received more than one input file.

In summary, your program should:

1. read the input source and create a list of valid files to process;
2. for each file in the list, count the individual lines of code,
   comments, and blank lines, store this information in a convenient data structure, and;
3. display the result of the counting into a single table, with information associated with each individual file.

Note that the display of the information inside the table should be sorted in ascending order according to the field the user requested.
The possibilities are:

- option `-s f`: sort data in ascending order by file name.
- option `-s t`: sort data in ascending order by file type.
- option `-s c`: sort data in ascending order by number of comment lines.
- option `-s b`: sort data in ascending order by number of blank lines.
- option `-s s`: sort data in ascending order by number of sloc lines.
- option `-s a`: sort data in ascending order by number of all lines.

To sort the table in reverse order the user must replace `-s` by `-S` and with the same arguments described above.

### Single line of code, comments, and blank lines

A **single line of code** (sloc) is a line inside a source file that contains any C/C++ piece of code. It may be a line with just a "`{`", for instance, or a line with a "`for`" loop, for example.

A **blank line** is a line that is not inside a comment block and has no code nor any type of comment marks.

Program comments are statements that you can include in the C/C++ code to help anyone reading the source code.
C++ supports single-line and multi-line comments. All characters available inside any comment are ignored by C++ compiler.
C++ comments may start with "`/*`" and end with "`*/`". For example:

```cpp
/* This is a comment */

/*
 * C++ comments can also
 * span multiple lines
 * inside a block comment.
 *
*/
```

A comment can also start with "`//`", at the beginning of a line or after a C++ statement. All that comes after the "`//`" is considered a comment.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(void) {
  std::cout << "Hello world!\n"; // This is a single end line comment.
  // This is a comment that occupies an entire line.
  int x{0}; // another example.
  //

  return 0;
}
```

Within a "`/*`" and "`*/`" block comment, the "`//`" characters have no special meaning and must be ignored. Similarly, within a single line "`//`" comment, the "`/*`" and "`*/`" have no special meaning.
Thus, it is possible to _"nest"_ one kind of comment within the other kind.

For example:

```cpp
/*
  Comment out a piece of code.

  for(int i{0}; i<10; i++ )
    std::cout << "(" << i+1 << "): Hello world!\n"; // prints Hello World

  //   another nested comment.
*/
```

Investigate this affirmation by creating several examples of nested comments to see which ones the compiler will reject as error.

Additionally, any comment mark that appears **inside** a string literal must also be ignored.

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main(void) {
  std::cout << "A comment in C++ beging with a " << "/*"
            << " and ends with a " << "*/" << std::end;
  // Another example.
  if ( str == "//") // The double slash inside if must be ignored.
    std::cout << "Found double slash\n";

  return 0;
}
```

But your program must have special care with some situations that might happened involving block comments.
For example, the code below

```c++
/* some comment */ int x = 0;
```

should be counted **both** as a comment and as a line of code.
The same goes for the code below

```c++
int x = 0; // This is both a comment and a sloc.
```

Another situation to look out for is when a multi line block comment ends and we still have a C/C++ statement on that line.

```c++
/* one
   two
   three */ int x = 0;
```

The code above should be counted as 3 lines of comment and 1 line of code.

## System Modeling

The first step is to identify which **entities** might help you model the problem.
Here goes some suggestions of entities involved in the problem.

### The list of source files

We may need to create a **list** of input source files and their types. Filling in this list is your program's first task. This is done based on the input source information collected via Command Line Argument. Recall that if the client sends a single file this list will have only a single element; whereas, if the client provide a directory, this list may end up with various entries, one for each valid source code file found in that directory.

### The `FileInfo` class/struct

This class or struct represents the collection of information gathered from a source file. They are the file name, file type (C, C++, C/C++ header or C++ header), number of blank lines, number of comment lines, number of single lines of code, and the total number of lines of the file.

To store the file information for each input file, we will need a **dynamic list** of `FileInfo`. This will work as the program's internal database that stores the counting result for each source file.

### Helper functions

To help you handle a line of code, you may need to create some useful functions. You might need, for instance, a function to convert a string to lowercase. This is useful if you wan to support files that may come with extension in upper case. Another useful functions are one that trims out any leading white space in a string, and another that trims out any trailing white spaces in a string.

## Output

The output of the program is a table with the counting information for each category of line, per source file.
In case the program has processed more than one source file, the table must present a summation (consolidation) of counts on the last line of the table.

The example below is from a directory with three source files.

```
$ ./build/sloc src/core
Files processed: 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename             Language        Comments        Blank           Code            All
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
src/core/cowsay.h    C/C++ header    93 (56.0%)      19 (11.4%)      96 (57.8%)      166
src/core/main_.cpp   C++             41 (64.1%)      7 (10.9%)       17 (26.6%)      64
src/core/cowsay.cpp  C++             165 (35.5%)     26 (5.6%)       330 (71.0%)     465
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUM                                  299             52              443             695
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Note that for each category of line you must show the number of lines **and** the percentage that this quantity represents in relation to the total number of lines of the source file. The percentage must be presented enclosed in parenthesis and must have one digit after the point.  
All the fields must be left aligned.
The columns may have a fixed width. In particular, the first column must grow in width to accommodate the largest file name found in the list.

### Error output

There are, at least, three possible input errors that your program must address:

1. The client provides either a non existing source file or a non existing directory.

```
$ ./build/sloc file.cpp
  Sorry, unable to read "file.cpp".
$ ./build/sloc source
  Sorry, unable to read "source".
```

2. The client provides an existing file but it is not a supported source file.

```
$ ./build/sloc file.tex
  Sorry, ".tex" files are not supported at this time.
```

3. The client provides an existing directory that does not contain any supported source file.

```
$ ./build/sloc src
  Sorry, unable to find any supported source file inside directory "src".
```

In any of these cases just described the program must print the proper error message and exit the program without printing an empty table.

Other possible errors your team must deal with is the wrong use of the configuration options and their arguments.
For example, it is an error to provide an invalid sorting field, or to provide an invalid option.

If you identify another error situation while developing the project feel free to treat it accordingly.
The important point here is that your program **must not crash** in any circumstance.
