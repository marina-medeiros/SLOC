# Introduction

Welcome to our programming project dedicated to the analysis of C/C++ source files! Counting lines of code (LOC) is a crucial metric in software development, offering insights into project size and complexity. By accurately measuring lines of code, comments, and blank lines, developers can objectively assess programming efforts and gauge documentation practices.

In this assignment, we've designed and developed a powerful terminal application to fulfill this need. Our tool efficiently counts lines of code, comments, and blank lines within one or more C/C++ source files provided as input. With a user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI), interaction with the application is intuitive and straightforward. Whether you're analyzing a single source file or a directory containing multiple files, our application delivers accurate line count information to the standard output.

# Problems found or limitations

We had trouble finding a way to make the program recognize relative paths of files.

# Compiling and Runnig

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have CMake installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`.
5. Generate the build files with CMake: `cmake ..`.
6. Compile the project: `cmake --build .`.
7. Run the compiled executable.
